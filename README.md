Feather
=======

Yet another Todo manager based on sinatra

### Feather

Feather(`鸿毛` in chinese) is suppsed to be a lightweight web application based on: 

-	[sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) (lightweight web framework)
-	[datamapper](http://datamapper.org/) (ORM)
-	[haml](http://haml.info/tutorial.html) (the template engine)
-	[omniauth](http://www.omniauth.org/) (authorization framework)
-	[backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) (client-side mvc framework)
-	[jquery-mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) (mobile framework)

But don't be scared by the `framework` in the list, they are all very simple and lightweight.

### Purpose

The purpose of this simple application is just used for learning the great web framework `sinatra` and some useful gems (such as factory-girl, rspec, omni-auth).
